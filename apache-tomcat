Under the "Binary Distributions" section, choose the package that matches your operating system and desired configuration. 
For Windows, you can typically choose the "32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer" option.

You can customize the selection based on your requirements.

7. Choose Startup Type: 
Select the startup type for Tomcat. You can choose either "Service (recommended)" or "Manual".

8. Configure User Name and Password: 
Set a username and password for the Tomcat administration web interface.

The default values are 8080 and 8443, respectively.

10. Complete the Installation:

You can deploy your web applications to the Tomcat server by placing the WAR files in the appropriate directory within the Tomcat installation. Remember to consult the official Apache Tomcat documentation for more detailed information and further configuration options.
