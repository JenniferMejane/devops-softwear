2. Create a Bootable USB Drive: Once the download is complete, create a bootable USB drive using software like Rufus (for Windows) or balenaEtcher (for Windows, macOS, and Linux). This will allow you to install Ubuntu from the USB drive.

3. Set Boot Priority: Restart your computer and enter the BIOS settings by pressing the appropriate key (F2, F12, Esc, etc.) during startup. In the BIOS settings, change the boot priority to prioritize booting from the USB drive.

5. Language and Keyboard Selection: Choose your preferred language and keyboard layout for the installation process.

6. Prepare Installation Options: On the "Installation type" screen, you can choose the installation type based on your requirements. For beginners, the "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" option is recommended for a straightforward installation. You may also choose the "Something else" option to manually configure disk partitions.

7. Set Location and Timezone: Provide your location and timezone information.

8. Create User Account: Enter your name, desired username, password, and computer name to create the user account for Ubuntu.

9. Installation Progress: The installation process will begin, with Ubuntu copying files and configuring the system.

10. Complete the Installation: Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to restart your computer. Remove the USB drive before rebooting.

11. Post-Installation Setup: Upon reboot, Ubuntu will load from the installed system. Follow the on-screen prompts to finalize the setup, including any system updates and additional configurations.
